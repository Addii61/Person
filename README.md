TestPerson Java Code
This is a simple Java code project that demonstrates the comparison of ages between two persons. The project contains two classes: Person and TestPerson. The Person class encapsulates the attributes and methods related to a person, while the TestPerson class serves as the main entry point to run a comparison between two persons.

Usage
Create instances of the Person class, providing a name and an age for each person:
Person p1 = new Person("Ahad", 15);
Person p2 = new Person("Rauf", 23);
Use the compareAge method to compare the ages of these two persons:
p1.compareAge(p2);
The program will print a message indicating whether the first person is older, younger, or of the same age as the second person.
Example Output
Person one is younger than Person two
